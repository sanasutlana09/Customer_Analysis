# Customer_Analysis
Data analytics project showing customer behavior analysis using python, sql and power BI.
# **📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Workflow
## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow—from loading and exploring a dataset in Python, to transforming it with SQL, and finally visualizing insights through a Power BI dashboard. The goal is to showcase practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, business intelligence, and storytelling.

## 📁 Dataset

Source: (Add your dataset source: Kaggle / public repository / internal data)

Format: CSV / Excel / SQL table

Description: Briefly explain what the dataset contains (e.g., sales data, customer behavior, operations metrics).

Size: (3901 rows/18 columns)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools
Programming	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
Databases	PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
Visualization	Power BI
Presentation	Gamma App
Other	Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
## 📌 Project Steps
1. **Data Loading (Python)**

Imported dataset using Pandas

Inspected data types, structure, and basic statistics

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Generated summary statistics

Created distribution plots, correlations, and trend visualizations

Highlighted key patterns and potential problem areas

3. **Data Cleaning**

Handled missing values (imputation/removal)

Removed duplicates

Standardized formats (dates, categories, numeric fields)

Engineered new features where necessary

4. **SQL Analysis**

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Executed queries for:

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Joins and subqueries

Window functions

Filtering and segmentation

Extracted insights to support dashboard development

5. **Power BI Dashboard**

Connected to processed dataset / SQL database

Built interactive visuals:

KPIs

Line & bar charts

Slicers/filters

Drill-through views

Published dashboard for easy stakeholder access

6. **Report & Presentation**

Summarized findings in a structured analytics report

Created a clean, visual presentation using Gamma App

Highlighted business implications and recommendations

## 📈 Dashboard

Include a link or screenshot here:

Power BI Dashboard: ["C:\Users\Syed Arshad\Downloads\customer_analysis.pbix"]

Key pages: Overview, Trends, Segmentation, KPIs

## 🧠 Results / Key Insights

(Add 3–5 bullet points summarizing your most important findings, e.g.,)

Sales peaked in Q3 due to promotional campaigns

Customer churn correlated strongly with service delays

Region A contributed 40% of total revenue

Inventory inefficiencies led to a 15% cost increase
